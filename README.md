# üèó Scaffold-ETH Bar Dice - Shake-o-day

Bar dice is a game played at many bars across the state of Wisconsin.  Most bars come up with their own rules, but they all contain around the same premise.  The cost to play is cheap, the pot to win is high, and you want to roll the same numbers. This game is no different and has been adapted to play on the EVM.  To play you will need .1 ETH and to win you need to be the highest player that won that day.  The winnings will be half the pot size, minus a 5% fee that will get sent to a charity.   Each address can play once per day. 

Since only one player can play at a time, there will be a time limit for a turn.  You get 1 minute to play, if someone takes longer than 1 minute, they will still be ‚Äòplaying‚Äô but the clock will be expired and someone can play the game and it will kick the player that was holding up the show out.  3 strikes and you are on a banned list and cannot play for a calendar year, and the address will be on the wall of shame. 

## Scoring

Scoring is a two-digit number that represents two things.  The first digit is the number of dice that are the same.  The second is the number on the dice, that is the same.  

An example, If 5 dice were rolled, and the numbers were 2,3,4,5,5 the score would be 25, because there are two 5‚Äôs.  Now if you *farmed* the 5‚Äôs and rolled again and got 5,5,1,**5,5**. the score would be 45.  

## Farming

Players are allowed the farm 3 times - called, all day.  

## Pot Size

The pot size will start at 0 and go up .1 ETH for every player and 50% will be going into the prize pool.  95% going to the winner(s) of the day - and their address/ENS name will displayed on the wall of fame, and 5% going to charity.  They will have to claim their prize to pay the gas fee, they will have 30 days to claim their prize or it will go to charity - their name will be highlighted gold if the prize is not collected.

Let‚Äôs assume that 50 players play a day.  that would be 5.0 ETH the payout.  That would mean 2.375 ETH would go to the winner(s) and .125 ETH would go to charity.

Now, let's imagine this is the talk of the town, and people are playing this non-stop.  60 minutes times 24 hours, let's say people write a few bots to play, there could easily be 1500 entries a day, or 15 ETH.   .75 ETH would go to charity and 6.25 ETH would go to the winner(s)!

Now that is day one since the pot will grow due to 50% of the pot remaining - to the moon!
